## Overview of the Analysis

-This analysis was done to help our investors decide whether the ice cream and surfboard shop would be financially viable year-round. To do this, I looked at temperatures during June and December of last year, and drawing on their statistics to come to a conclusion.

## Results

-The first difference between the two dates is the average temperature falls from 74 to 71 degrees from June to December.
-The second difference is the minimum temperatures. June has a minimum temperature of 64 degrees, whereas December has a minimum temperature of of 56 degrees.
-The third difference is the standard deviation. June has a std. dev. of 3.25, whereas December has a std. dev. of 3.75.

## Summary

-In conclusion, June and December have relatively similair average temps. The key difference would be the variance in temps between the two months. December is more likely to have colder days, therefore being less financially viable. Two other queries I would write would be to look at the amount and frequency of percipitation during these months. Personally, I don't think that rain and surfing mix well.
